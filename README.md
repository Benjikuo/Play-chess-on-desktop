## 🛠️ Why I built this  
- I’ve always wanted to play chess on my desktop.  
- It’s a great opportunity to learn how computers play chess.  
- It’s fun to “teach” a computer how to play the game.

## 🧩 Features
- 🎮 **Interactive Chessboard** – Drag, click, and play directly on screen  
- 🤖 **AI Opponent** – Simple minimax engine with positional evaluation  
- 💾 **Save & Load** – Game automatically stored in `chess_save.json`  
- ⏪ **Undo / Redo / Replay** – Step through previous game states  
- 🔁 **Board Flip** – Instantly switch perspective  
- 🧠 **AI Move Highlights** – Shows AI’s thinking process  
- ♕ **Pawn Promotion UI** – Pick your new piece visually  
- 🎥 **Animated Launcher** – Start the game via `chess_button.py` with pawn animation
